Git v1.7.10 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.9
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Improved handling of views, labels and branches in git-p4 (in contrib).

 * "git am" learned to pass "-b" option to underlying "git mailinfo", so
   that bracketed string other than "PATCH" at the beginning can be kept.

 * "git clone" learned "--single-branch" option to limit cloning to a
   single branch (surprise!).

 * When showing a patch while ignoring whitespace changes, the context
   lines are taken from the postimage, in order to make it easier to
   view the output.

Performance

 * During "git upload-pack" in respose to "git fetch", unnecessary calls
   to parse_object() have been eliminated, to help performance in
   repositories with excessive number of refs.

Internal Implementation

 * Recursive call chains in "git index-pack" to deal with long delta
   chains have been flattened, to reduce the stack footprint.

 * Use of add_extra_ref() API is slowly getting removed, to make it
   possible to cleanly restructure the overall refs API.

 * The test suite supports the new "test_pause" helper function.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.9 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * When "git push" fails to update any refs, the client side did not
   report an error correctly to the end user.
   (merge 5238cbf sp/smart-http-failure-to-push later to maint).

 * "git push -q" was not sufficiently quiet.
   (merge d336572 cb/push-quiet later to maint).

 * "git log --first-parent $pathspec" did not stay on the first parent
   chain and veered into side branch from which the whole change to the
   specified paths came.
   (merge 36ed191 jc/maint-log-first-parent-pathspec later to maint).

 * Subprocesses spawned from various git programs were often left running
   to completion even when the top-level process was killed.
   (merge 10c6cdd cb/maint-kill-subprocess-upon-signal later to maint).
